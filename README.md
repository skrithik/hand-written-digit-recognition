# üß† MNIST Neural Network Experimentation

This repository contains a **Handwritten Digit Recognition** project built using **Python, TensorFlow, and Pandas**. The project demonstrates training multiple neural network models on the MNIST dataset with different dataset sizes and regularization techniques.

## üöÄ Features
- **trained a neural net model with 3 hidden layers and an output layer**
- **Data preprocessing** including handling missing values and duplicates.
- Comprehensive evaluation using **training and cross-validation** data.
- Analysis and discussion on **overfitting issues**.
- A **prediction function** to classify new handwritten digits.

## üìÇ Dataset
The MNIST dataset, comprising 70,000 images of handwritten digits, was used. For experimentation, subsets of **12,000** and **20,000** entries were extracted to assess the impact of dataset size and regularization on model performance.

## üìå Process Overview

1. **Loaded Dependencies**:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import tensorflow as tf
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
   from tensorflow.keras.activations import linear, relu, sigmoid
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import pandas as pd
   ```
2. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the MNIST dataset.
   - Handled missing values and removed duplicates to ensure data quality.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Built and trained 4 models with different dataset sizes and regularization settings.
   - Compared their accuracies on both training and cross-validation data.
4. **Overfitting Analysis**:
   - Identified overfitting issues, particularly in models trained without regularization.
   - Discussed the impact of dataset size and regularization on model performance.
5. **Prediction Function**:
   - Implemented a function to preprocess input images and predict the digit using the trained models.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (for building and training neural networks)
- **Pandas** (for data processing)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

## üî• Future Improvements
- Experiment with additional regularization techniques.
- Explore deeper network architectures.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for further performance enhancement.
- Integrate the prediction function into a web interface for real-time digit recognition.
