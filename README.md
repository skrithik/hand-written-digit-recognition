# 🧠 MNIST Neural Network Experimentation

This repository contains a **Handwritten Digit Recognition** project built using **Python, TensorFlow, and Pandas**. The project demonstrates training multiple neural network models on the MNIST dataset with different dataset sizes and regularization techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- **trained a neural net model with 3 hidden layers and an output layer**
- **Data preprocessing** including handling missing values and duplicates.
- Comprehensive evaluation using **training and cross-validation** data.
- Analysis and discussion on **overfitting issues**.
- A **prediction function** to classify new handwritten digits.

## 📂 Dataset
The MNIST dataset, comprising 70,000 images of handwritten digits, was used. For experimentation, subsets of **12,000** and **20,000** entries were extracted to assess the impact of dataset size and regularization on model performance.

## 📌 Process Overview

1. **Load the Dependencies**
2. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the MNIST dataset.
   - Handled missing values and removed duplicates to ensure data quality.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Built and trained 4 models with different dataset sizes and regularization settings.
   - Compared their accuracies on both training and cross-validation data.
4. **Overfitting Analysis**:
   - Identified overfitting issues, particularly in models trained without regularization.
   - Discussed the impact of dataset size and regularization on model performance.
5. **Prediction Function**:
   - Implemented a function to preprocess input images and predict the digit using the trained models.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (for building and training neural networks)
- **Pandas** (for data processing)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Experiment with additional regularization techniques.
- Explore deeper network architectures.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for further performance enhancement.
- Integrate the prediction function into a web interface for real-time digit recognition.
